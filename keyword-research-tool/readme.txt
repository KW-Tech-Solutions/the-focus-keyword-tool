A recreation of an internal tool previously used to help companies perform local SEO to wild success. Simple to use, effective results. 

== Description ==

Discover relevant keyword suggestions, specific to your location (or rather the location of your server). Simply enter your focus keyword, and it will provide relevant suggestions. 
Group terms which interests to you, and run it through the system to find common topics to target. 

= How do you use this WordPress plugin to perform keyword research? =

1. Enter your main focus keyword and run the search function. 
2. Select a few of the terms which appear interesting to you and run the grouped search function. 
3. Copy down the top few suggested list of keywords, and plug them into your blog post or page! 

= History of The Focus Keyword Tool =
- back in 2020, some businesses faced an issue with figuring out what to write
- while there were tools that helped generate keywords, none helped find an "intersection" between different keywords
- this is especially important when most of the time, you don't really want to talk about just one topic, or, you just know the item would get hits for closely related items
- furthermore, most keywords tool are extremely opaque, with no clear explanation of how the solution works, resulting in frustration for the users
- in 2024, realised there are still no good solutions, and nearly no standalone solution for this on WordPress

= How Does It Work? =
- the plugin takes your initial focus keyword to the top search results for it
- from the top search results, it digs into the words google find relevant via extracting the content shown. It then displays it to you as related keywords. 
- after selecting your keyword group, it then takes the top google google judges as semantically relevant to the keywords selected, and attempts to draw correlations
- the results are then ranked, and displayed to you

= Notes =
Currently, this plugin only supports English.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is there a wait time between each generation? =

To prevent your server from being automatically flagged out as spam, there are some rate limitations to its usage.
For each item in the focus search field, there will be a 10 seconds gap between each trigger. 
There will also be a 3 minutes gap between each trigger of the focus button, and a 30 seconds gap between each keyword search trigger. 

This should not significantly affect normal usage. 

= Are there query limits? =

No, the code runs locally on your server it has no rate limits.
